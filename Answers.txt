Experiments:

1. 
Changing the contour area:
When the contour area is kept less, for E.g 10, the total area of change or score is more.  - 1593.5
This means it ingnores small changes like humans, or some vehicle movements outside the parking area. 
Bigger contour area then then smaller changes are ignored and so the score remains less

Eg. 10 min contour area -- score == 1593
Eg. 500 min contour area -- score = 1135
Eg . 600 min contour area -- score = 0

2. 
Some of the absdiff also detects lights (headlights) as changes. I think we do 
not need that as the dataset mainly tries to capture changes in the parking lot
i-e cars.
Also, detects day and night time lighting changes. 


Approx -- 2298 area of car when in certain distance 4000- if closer
5000 min contour area to detect cars. 
If too close, it's too much area
